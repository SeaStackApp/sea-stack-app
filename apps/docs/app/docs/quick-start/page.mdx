# Quick Start

Get SeaStack up and running on your local machine in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** >= 24.8.0
- **pnpm** 9.x (the repository uses pnpm as its package manager)
- **Docker** (for running PostgreSQL locally and later for container management)

<Callout type="note" title="Using the correct Node version">
SeaStack requires Node.js 24.8.0 or higher. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node versions.
</Callout>

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeaStackApp/sea-stack-app.git
cd sea-stack-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all dependencies for the entire monorepo.

### 3. Start PostgreSQL

SeaStack uses PostgreSQL as its database. Start a local instance using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

This command uses the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repository root and creates a persistent volume named `postgres_data`.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

You need to create environment files in two locations:

**packages/db/.env**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/public?schema=public"
```

**apps/web/.env**

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/public?schema=public"

# Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=dev_super_secret_change_me
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SSH key encryption (used to encrypt private keys before storing)
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=dev_encryption_secret_change_me
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Warning">
The secrets shown above are for development only. Use strong, unique secrets in production environments.
</Callout>

### 5. Set Up the Database

Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm -w --filter @repo/db generate

# Push schema to database
pnpm -w --filter @repo/db db:push
```

Alternatively, you can use migrations:

```bash
pnpm -w --filter @repo/db migrate:dev
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command uses Turborepo to start all development servers. The main web UI will be available at:

**http://localhost:3000**

<Callout type="success" title="You're all set!">
SeaStack is now running on your local machine. You can create an account and start managing servers.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

Now that you have SeaStack running, here are some things you can do:

1. **Add a Server**: Register your first remote server
2. **Configure SSH**: Set up SSH key authentication
3. **Explore the UI**: Familiarize yourself with the dashboard

Check out the [Server Management](/docs/servers) guide to learn more about managing your infrastructure with SeaStack.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to the database, verify that:

- PostgreSQL is running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
- The connection string in your `.env` files is correct
- No other service is using port 5432

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Make sure you're using Node.js 24.8.0 or higher
2. Clear the build cache: `pnpm clean` (if available)
3. Remove `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`

### Port Conflicts

If port 3000 is already in use, you can change the port in `apps/web/package.json`:

```json
"dev": "next dev --port 3001"
```
