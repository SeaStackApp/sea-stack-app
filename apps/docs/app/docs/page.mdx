# Introduction to SeaStack

SeaStack helps you manage remote servers and deploy containerized applications using Docker Swarm, all routed behind a Traefik proxy. The goal is a simple, open-source control plane where you can register servers, run commands securely, and orchestrate app deployments on a Swarm cluster with sensible defaults.

<Callout type="note" title="Open Source">
SeaStack is fully open source and contributions are welcome! Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/SeaStackApp/sea-stack-app?tab=readme-ov-file#contribution-guidelines) to get started.
